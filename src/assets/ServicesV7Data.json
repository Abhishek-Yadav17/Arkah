      "We combine the strengths of traditional oil & gas with the promise of renewable energy systems—from onshore rigs and reservoirs to biogas digesters. At the same time, we maximize hydrocarbon recovery through reservoir-centric strategies, deploying proven methods such as waterflooding, polymer flooding, Improved Oil Recovery (IOR) and Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) techniques. This integrated approach ensures we meet current energy needs while unlocking long-term performance and positioning ourselves at the forefront of the low-carbon future."
